In this blog, I'll explain you how to create a sitemap for your site at buildtime using the gatsby-plugin-sitemap. I wasted a whole day in trying to make this package work. It wasn't well documented, and the only tutorials I found online were no longer upto date( my guess is the plugin introduced a breaking change in its latest versions). I finally had to read and modify the source-code of the package to understand how it works and debug the issue. So am writing this post to save the time of others like me. Let's go...

## Installing the package

The first step is to install the package. This can be done easily by typing

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-sitemap # or yarn add gatsby-plugin-sitemap
```

in your shell.

## Configuring the package

Next, add the following to your `gatsby-config.js` file. The `query` assumes that you have `siteUrl` set in the `siteMetadata` in this config file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    // other configuration
    plugins: [

        // other plugins

        {
            resolve: "gatsby-plugin-sitemap",
            options: {
                query: 
                    `{
                        site {
                            siteMetadata {
                                siteUrl
                            }
                        }

                        allSitePage {
                            nodes {
                                path
                            }
                        }
                    }`,
            }
        },
    ]
}
```

## Testing the package

With this added, use  `gatsby build`  to build the site, and then serve it using `gatsby serve` (*This is required as sitemaps are not generated in development mode*)
You should now be able to see a sitemap for your site. Browse the `public/` folder for the exact location of the endpoint.

The sitemap generated should look something like this

```xml
<url>
    <loc>https://pranavjoglekarcodes.web.app/dev-404-page/</loc>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
<url>
    <loc>https://pranavjoglekarcodes.web.app/offline-plugin-app-shell-fallback/</loc>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
<url>
    <loc>https://pranavjoglekarcodes.web.app/blogs/posts/2021/wordpress_docker_setup/</loc>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
<url>
    <loc>https://pranavjoglekarcodes.web.app/blogs/posts/2021/phishinder/</loc>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
```

This default configuration should work for most cases, but if you want to configure more, read ahead

## Beyond the basic configuration

Before extending the basic configuration, let us understand the fields shown -

### changefreq:
This tells the crawler how often your page changes. This can take the following values - always, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, never
For a normal site daily seems to be a suitable option

### priority
This tells the crawler which of your pages are important, and which of these have a lower importance. This can be any value between(including) 0.0 and 1.0. This is a **relative** measure and does not affect the priorities of other sites.

### lastmod
This is a datestamp to tell google that the content of the page has been updated

## Understanding gatsby-plugin-sitemap options

You can easily refer the official plugin documentation to understand the configuration options, so I won't be explaining you those again. I will just add certain points, which I feel should be present in the documentation, that I learned after inspecting & decoding the plugin

- Try to keep the `query` of the form
  
  ```javascript
    allSitePage {
      nodes {
          path
      }
    }
  ```
 rather than
  ```javascript
    allSitePage {
        edges {
            node {
                path
            }
        }
    }
  ```

*Note: This was the other way around previously, so I wont be suprised if it changes again*

- The `query` output is passed to the `resolvePages` function. The output of the `resolvePages` is passed to the `serialize` function. If we are using a custom `resolvePages`function, we need to pass a custom `serialize`function and vice-versa.
  
- The output array of the `resolvePages` must contain a `path` attribute
  
- If you are passing a `filterPages` function, it is called on the array returned by `resolvePages`, before being passed to serialize

## Sample Advanced Configuration

```javascript
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-sitemap",
      options: {
        query: 
        `{
            site {
              siteMetadata {
                siteUrl
              }
            }

            allSitePage {
              nodes {
                path
              }
            }
          }`,
        resolvePages: ({ site, allSitePage }) => {
          const temp= allSitePage.nodes
            .map((node) => {
              if(node.path == "<YOUR HOMEPAGE PATH>")
                  return {
                    path: site.siteMetadata.siteUrl + node.path,
                    changefreq: 'daily',
                    priority: 1,
                  };
              else
                  return {
                    path: site.siteMetadata.siteUrl + node.path,
                    changefreq: 'daily',
                    priority: 1,
                  };
            });
           return temp;
        },
        serialize: ({path, changefreq, priority}) => {
          return {
            url: path,
            changefreq: changefreq,
            priority: priority,
          }
        },
      }
    },
```

## Tips

1. If you have multiple urls pointing to the same domain, you need to set up one of those as a canonical url. Refer to [this](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/gatsby/seo-friendly-sitemap/) blog by Josh Comeau for inspiration on how to do this.
  
2. I was facing an issue to get this work, and the error messages provided by the package were cryptic. So I modified the plugin source files in node_modules/ to return me the appropriate error logs, which helped me debug this issue_
