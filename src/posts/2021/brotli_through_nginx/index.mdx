Picture this - You create a beautiful website in React. It works flawlessly. The transitions are smooth and everyone loves it. You deploy it on the web. You know someone talking about something called the lighthouse score, you decide to check it out and VHAM. The site has very poor performance. A quick google search tells you to use Brotli and Gzip compressions. But you can't find an easy guide to do this with React. Well, let me help you out

## Building the Website

The first step is to create builds which contain files in these format.

### Install with custom webpack configuration

1. install the required webpack plugins and dependencies by running the following scripts

```shell
npm install --save-dev compression-webpack-plugin
npm install --save-dev brotli-webpack-plugin
```

2. modify the webpack.config.json to the following
  
  ```javascript
  const CompressionPlugin = require('compression-webpack-plugin'); //gzip
  const BrotliPlugin = require('brotli-webpack-plugin'); //brotli
  ```
  
  ```
  module.exports = {
    ...
    plugins: [
        new CompressionPlugin({ //gzip plugin
            filename: '[path].gz[query]',
            algorithm: 'gzip',
            test: /\.(js|css|html|svg)$/,
            threshold: 8192,
            minRatio: 0.8
        }),
        new BrotliPlugin({ //brotli plugin
            asset: '[path].br[query]',
            test: /\.(js|css|html|svg)$/,
            threshold: 10240,
            minRatio: 0.8
        })
    ]
  }
  ```
  

### Install with CRA(Create-React-App)

Unfortunately, CRA does not allow us to modify the custom webpack configuration easily. There are ways like `npm run eject` to get out of the CRA ecosystem, but it is not adviced. So I decided to try out the `compress-create-react-app`

1. Install the package

````
```sh
npm i compress-create-react-app
````

2. Modify the build script in package.json
  
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build && compress-cra",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
  ```
  

Once these things have been configured, build the app once(`npm run build`). You should now see files with .br and .gzip extensions in the `build` folder. If you don't, you must have missed something, retry the previous steps

## Purging Nginx

We will need to rebuild nginx with brotli support again, so, if you already have nginx installed. Delete it using the following command

```shell
sudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common nginx-full
```

If you find some other dependencies depend on the package, you would need to remove those first

## Downloading Requirements

Next, we'll install the dependencies required for the process

```sh
sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev build-essential gnupg2 git gcc cmake libpcre3 libpcre3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-
dev openssl libssl-dev curl unzip -y
```

Now, we'll install the latest version of nginx. For that, we'll first need to add the nginx repositories to our machine.

- Import the Nginx GPG key required
  
  ```sh
  curl -L https://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key | apt-key add -
  ```
  
- Add the Nginx Repository. Open the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list`and add the following lines
  
  ```sh
  deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ focal nginx
  deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ focal nginx
  ```
  
- Update the repository
  
  ```shell
  apt-get update -y
  ```
  
- cd to `/usr/local/source` and download source
  
  ```sh
  apt-get source nginx
  ```
  
- Download the latest version of Brotli from the Git repository(Again in the `/usr/local/src` folder)
  
  ```sh
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli.git
  ```
  

## Building Nginx

Let us now move on to building nginx. Install the build dependencies by the following command

```sh
apt-get build-dep nginx -y
```

Edit the debian/rules file in the nginx source folder. Use this command to open the file

```shell
cd /usr/local/src/nginx-*/
nano debian/rules
```

and add the following to the `./configure`command under the `config.env.nginx` and `config.env.nginx_debug`

```sh
--add-module=/usr/local/src/ngx_brotli
```

Now, we'll build and install nginx in the system.

Use the following command to build nginx for your system

```sh
dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us
```

If you get an unmet dependencies error. e.g

```sh
error: Unmet build dependencies: debhelper
```

run

```sh
sudo apt-get installl <unmet-dependency-name>
```

to install the dependency and fix the error.

After the build completes, verify that it has created .deb files in the /usr/local/src directory.

If you have these files, install nginx by running

```sh
dpkg -i /usr/local/src/*.deb
```

After installtion run, `nginx -v` to verify nginx was installed succesfully

## Configuring Nginx with Gzip & Brotli Support

Now let's move on to the final section, where we'll configure nginx to serve files using gzip and brotli

Open the nginx configuration file

```shell
nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

and add the following lines inside the http section

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_proxied any;
gzip_comp_level 6;
gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml application/json application/javascript application/xml+rss application/atom+xml image/svg+xml;

brotli on;
brotli_comp_level 6;
brotli_static on;
brotli_types text/plain text/css application/javascript application/x-javascript text/xml 
application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript image/x-icon 
image/vnd.microsoft.icon image/bmp image/svg+xml;
```

These configurations allow nginx to serve files using gzip and brotli compressions.

Save this file and test if the configuration is valid using

```sh
nginx -t
```

If you get a successful message, start the nginx server to serve the files

```shell
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

Verify that the server is running, using

```sh
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

To verify if compressed files are being served, go to the networkt tab in your browser and inspect the headers of the files being downloaded. If you find the Content-Encoding header with a value of br(brotli) or gzip, Congrats- You have successfully enabled brotli compression.
